# Project "Blanchard"

For Blanchard, a company specializing in the sale of art objects, I developed a high-quality website that fully adheres to strict requirements for layout and user experience.

## General Technical Requirements

- **Responsive and semantic markup:** The code was optimized to minimize the number of tags and nesting, ensuring a clean and lightweight structure.
- 
- **Pixel-perfect across all resolutions:** It was important to achieve maximum layout precision, with deviations no greater than 1-3 pixels, ensuring all elements looked flawless on any device.

- **Cross-browser compatibility:** The landing page was thoroughly tested and fine-tuned to display perfectly across all modern browsers — **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, **Opera**, and **Edge** — providing users with a consistent experience regardless of platform.

- **Portrait and landscape mode compatibility:** The content was fully accessible and adapted for both horizontal and vertical orientations.

- **Accessibility:** Ensured the website looks visually appealing and remains accessible to users on any resolution, every interactive area on the site was clearly indicated with hover effects and a pointer cursor, while the default outline was replaced with a custom :focus pseudo-class for clickable elements..

- **Mobile optimization:** On mobile devices, hover effects were replaced with :active styles to improve interaction.

- **Code Quality:** Validated HTML, CSS, and ensured compliance with coding standards, maintaining clean and error-free code.

## Project Features

- The development was closely integrated with the Swiper library, which was used to create sliders. I customized the library for various types of sliders, adapting them for all screen resolutions while maintaining accessibility (A11y). This allowed users to seamlessly navigate the site on both mobile devices and desktops.

- The website smoothly transitions during resizing without abrupt changes at breakpoints.

- A key part of the project was JavaScript development. I implemented interactive tabs and accordions to switch content between different artists. To enhance the user experience, I also created smooth and visually appealing animations for content transitions, adding an extra layer of visual appeal and dynamism to the interface.

- Additionally, the project required managing large, high-quality JPEG images. To optimize load times while preserving image quality, I converted these images to WebP format, reducing their file size significantly and improving site performance without compromising on visual clarity.

- Ensured the site's visual appeal and accessibility across various resolutions.

- HTML, CSS, and HTMLHint validators confirmed the absence of errors, demonstrating code quality and compliance with coding standards.
